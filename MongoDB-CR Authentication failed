I am unbale to create a new user getting the error called MongoDB-CR Authentication failed
This is how i resolved this error

1) Start 3.0 without auth enabled. (Auth needs to be disabled otherwise you'll get the not authorized error).

2) Run (after selecting "admin"use db):

var schema = db.system.version.findOne({"_id" : "authSchema"})

schema.currentVersion = 3

db.system.version.save(schema)
3) restart mongodb with auth enabled.

4) Create a new admin user (the old one, the one you created before this workaround won't work).
